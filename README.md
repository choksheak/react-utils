# @choksheak/react-utils

This package is a time-tested collection of React utilities written in
TypeScript that I have personally needed in almost every project that I have
worked in. Making this an open source, public npm package allows me to share
this code freely with others as well as using it for my own personal and
professional projects. Feel free to use it in your own projects without any
restrictions.

The code supports full tree-shaking. Therefore your code will only grow in size
by whatever you use. Any code that you are not using will not contribute to your
code size.
